# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the design, features, and development plan for the Flutter journaling application. It serves as a single source of truth for the project's current state and future direction.

## Implemented Features

### Authentication

*   **Firebase Authentication:** The application uses Firebase Authentication to manage user sign-up, login, and session management.
*   **Email/Password Authentication:** Users can create an account and log in using their email and password.
*   **Authentication Gate:** The application has an authentication gate (`AuthGate`) that directs users to the appropriate screen (login or home) based on their authentication state.
*   **Login Page:** A dedicated login page (`LoginPage`) with email and password fields, a login button, and a link to the registration page. The UI has been redesigned to be more modern and user-friendly.
*   **Registration Page:** A registration page (`RegistrationPage`) for new users to create an account.
*   **Forgot Password:** Users can reset their password via a link sent to their email address. This is handled by a new `ForgotPasswordPage` and the `sendPasswordResetEmail` method in `AuthService`.
*   **Loading Indicators:** The login and registration pages now display a loading indicator during the authentication process to provide better user feedback.
*   **Optimized Registration:** The user creation process is now faster as it no longer waits for the initial user data to be written to the Realtime Database.

### Firestore

*   **Cloud Firestore:** The application uses Cloud Firestore to store and retrieve journal entries in real-time.
*   **Data Structure:** Journal entries are stored in a `journals` collection, with each user's entries organized in a subcollection named `entries` under a document identified by their unique user ID.
*   **Security Rules:** The database is secured with rules that only allow authenticated users to read and write their own journal entries.

### Features

*   **Weather Page (`WeatherPage`):** A dedicated page to display the current weather conditions for a searched city. It includes a search bar, the current temperature, a weather icon, and additional details like humidity, wind speed, and pressure. The page uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data.

### User Interface

*   **Main Interface (`HomePage`):** A new dashboard-style home screen that greets the user and provides navigation to different app features like "Weather" and "Diary". It also includes a "SPECIAL FOR YOU" section with Bible quotes.
*   **Journal Page (`JournalPage`):** The screen where users can view, add, edit, and delete their journal entries. The UI has been redesigned to match the user-provided image, featuring a cleaner layout, a floating action button for adding entries, and restyled entry cards.
*   **Expanded Journal View:** When a user taps on a journal entry, it expands into a detailed view, showing the full content of the entry. This view also has a back button and an edit button.
*   **Journal Entry Dialog:** A dialog for adding and editing journal entries with separate fields for title and content.
*   **Journal List:** A list of all journal entries, displayed in descending chronological order.
*   **Confirmation Dialog:** A confirmation dialog is now displayed before deleting a journal entry to prevent accidental data loss.
*   **Styling:** The application uses the `google_fonts` package for custom typography and a consistent color scheme based on Material Design principles.

## Current Plan

### Implemented: Weather Feature

*   **Objective:** To allow users to check the weather for a specific city.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **`http` Package:** Added the `http` package to the `pubspec.yaml` file to make API requests.
    2.  **`WeatherPage` Creation:** Created a new `lib/weather_page.dart` file with a stateful widget to manage the weather data.
    3.  **API Integration:** Integrated the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data using the provided API key.
    4.  **UI Implementation:** Designed a user interface with a search bar and a card to display the weather information.
    5.  **Routing:** Added a new `/weather` route in `lib/main.dart` and updated the `HomePage` to navigate to it.

### Implemented: Expanded Journal Entry View

*   **Objective:** To allow users to view the full content of a journal entry by tapping on it.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **`JournalBody` as `StatefulWidget`:** Converted `JournalBody` to a `StatefulWidget` to manage the selected entry's state.
    2.  **`_JournalDetailView`:** Created a new `_JournalDetailView` widget to display the expanded entry, including the full text, a back button, and an edit button.
    3.  **`AnimatedSwitcher`:** Implemented an `AnimatedSwitcher` to provide a smooth fade transition between the journal list and the detailed view.
    4.  **Navigation:** Tapping a `_JournalListItem` now updates the state to show the `_JournalDetailView`, and the back button reverts the state.

### Implemented: Redesigned Journal Page UI

*   **Objective:** To update the journal page with a new, modern UI based on the user-provided image.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Layout:** The `JournalPage` has been redesigned with a new header, a floating action button for adding entries, and restyled cards for each journal entry.
    2.  **Add/Edit Dialog:** The `_showJournalEntryDialog` now handles both adding and editing entries, with separate fields for the title and content.
    3.  **Delete Confirmation:** A confirmation dialog is now displayed before deleting a journal entry to prevent accidental data loss.

### Implemented: New Main Interface

*   **Objective:** To create a central navigation hub for the application as per the user's design.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **File Renaming:** Renamed the existing `lib/home_page.dart` to `lib/journal_page.dart`.
    2.  **New Home Page Creation:** Created a new `lib/home_page.dart` to serve as the main interface, featuring a dashboard layout.
    3.  **Routing Updates:** Updated `lib/main.dart` to include a new `/journal` route pointing to `JournalPage` and ensured the `/home` route directs to the new `HomePage`.
    4.  **Navigation:** The "Diary" card on the new `HomePage` now navigates to the `/journal` route.

### Implemented: Redesigned Forgot Password Page UI

*   **Objective:** To create a modern and visually appealing "Forgot Password" screen based on the user-provided design.
*   **Key Changes:**
    *   **Layout:** Adopted a centered, single-column layout for a clean and focused user experience.
    *   **Title and Subtitle:** Added a prominent "FORGOT PASSWORD" title and a descriptive subtitle.
    *   **Text Field:** The email field has been updated to include a prefix icon (`email_outlined`) and an underline border.
    *   **Button:** The "RESET" button is now a full-width `ElevatedButton` with a light blue background color and rounded corners.
    *   **Navigation:** Added a "Back to Sign In" `TextButton` to allow users to easily return to the login page.
    *   **Error Handling:** Kept the improved error handling to provide clear feedback to the user.

### Implemented: Forgot Password Functionality

*   **Objective:** To allow users to reset their password if they have forgotten it.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **`AuthService` Update:** Added a `sendPasswordResetEmail` method to `lib/auth_service.dart` that uses `FirebaseAuth.instance.sendPasswordResetEmail`.
    2.  **`ForgotPasswordPage` Creation:** Created a new page (`lib/forgot_password_page.dart`) with a form for the user to enter their email address.
    3.  **Routing:** Added a new route for `/forgot-password` in `lib/main.dart` to navigate to the `ForgotPasswordPage`.
    4.  **UI Connection:** Linked the "Forgot Password?" button on the `LoginPage` to the new `/forgot-password` route.

### Implemented: Redesigned Login Page UI

*   **Objective:** To create a modern and visually appealing login screen based on the user-provided design.
*   **Key Changes:**
    *   **Layout:** Adopted a centered, single-column layout for a clean and focused user experience.
    *   **Title:** Added a prominent "SIGN IN" title with a large, bold font.
    *   **Text Fields:** The email and password fields have been updated to include prefix icons (`person_outline` and `lock_outline`) and an underline border for a more polished look.
    *   **Buttons:** 
        *   The "Register Here" link is now a `TextButton` aligned to the right.
        *   The "LOGIN" button has been transformed into a full-width `ElevatedButton` with a vibrant blue background color and rounded corners.
        *   A "Forgot Password?" `TextButton` has been added at the bottom.
    *   **Spacing:** Increased the spacing between UI elements to improve readability and visual balance.
    *   **AppBar Removal:** The `AppBar` has been removed to create a more immersive and focused login screen.

### Implemented: Optimize Registration Speed

*   **Objective:** To reduce the perceived latency during new user registration.
*   **Action:**
    *   Modified the `createUserWithEmailAndPassword` method in `lib/auth_service.dart`.
    *   Removed the `await` from the Realtime Database `set` operation (`_rtdb.child('users').child(user.uid).set(...)`).
    *   This allows the app to proceed to the home screen immediately after Firebase Authentication is successful, while the database write happens in the background.

### Implemented: Add Loading Indicators to Authentication

*   **Objective:** To provide visual feedback to the user during the login and registration processes.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Add `_isLoading` state:** Introduced a boolean `_isLoading` to manage the visibility of the loading indicator.
    2.  **Show `CircularProgressIndicator`:** Conditionally display a `CircularProgressIndicator` when `_isLoading` is true.
    3.  **Update State:** Set `_isLoading` to `true` before the asynchronous authentication call and to `false` after it completes (in a `finally` block to handle both success and failure cases).
    4.  **Apply to both Login and Registration:** Implemented this logic on both `lib/login_page.dart` and `lib/registration_page.dart`.
